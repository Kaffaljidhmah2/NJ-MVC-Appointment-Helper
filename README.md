### Configuration & Deployment

- `git clone https://github.com/tangbao/njmvc_appt_helper.git`
- [Optional but recommended] Create and activate your virtual env, like Anaconda.
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Under `secrets` folder,
    - Create `token.secret`, and put your token inside.
    - Create `authorized_users.secret`, and put the ids of authorized users inside, one per line, if you want only the 
      authorized users can use the subscription function. If you hope everyone can use it, set `REQUIRE_AUTH` in 
      `config.py` as `False`.
